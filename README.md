# Magic-Gamma-Telescope

In this project, we tested different classifiers on "Magic Gamma Telescope" data and compared their performances. The steps for the project are:
1-Model Construction: Classification
2-Implementation & Model Evaluation
3-Preparing related questions & answers

◦ Holdout, Bagging, Boosting methods are implied on all classifiers which are Decision Tree C., Naive Bayes C., Artificial Neural Network C., and Support Vector Machine C.
◦ One of the classifier choosen for Cross-Validation Method (One of the Decision Trees).
◦ For the conclusion and interpretation, confusion matrix and classfication report method (from sklearn.metrics class) are used .
◦ These methods prints evaluation metrics like recall, accuracy, f1-score, etc
